**Welcome to AkikazeCP!**

This is me, Akikaze, the author of this repo.
This is my public repo, used to store all the source code of all competitive programming platform I've participated before.
Follow me through [my Codeforces account](https://www.codeforces.com/profile/Akikaze).

*Note: Sometimes I included source codes from my partners of #Team4T. Theirs are much cleaner than mine to be honest.*
