/*

Given a sequence of n elements, the majority vote problem asks to find
an element that occurs more frequently than all others, or determine
that no such element exists. Formally, a value must occur strictly
greater than floor(n/2) times to be considered the majority element.
Boyer-Moore majority vote algorithm scans through the sequence and
keeps track of a running counter for the most likely candidate so far.
Whenever a value is equal to the current candidate, the counter is
incremented, otherwise the counter is decremented. When the counter is
zero, the candidate is eliminated and a new candidate is considered.

The following implementation takes two random access iterators as the
sequence [lo, hi) of elements and returns an iterator pointing to one
instance of the majority element if it exists, or the iterator hi if
there is no majority.

Time Complexity: O(n) on the size of the array.
Space Complexty: O(1) auxiliary.
