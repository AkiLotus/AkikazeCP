/*

Description: Given a flow network, find a flow from a single
source node to a single sink node that is maximized. Note
that in this implementation, the adjacency list adj[] will
be modified by the function edmonds_karp() after it's been called.

Complexity: O(min(V*E^2, E*|F|)), where V is the number of
vertices, E is the number of edges, and |F| is the magnitude of
the max flow. This improves the original Ford-Fulkerson algorithm,
which runs in O(E*|F|). As the Edmonds-Karp algorithm is also
bounded by O(E*|F|), it is guaranteed to be at least as fast as
Ford-Fulkerson. For an even faster algorithm, see Dinic's
algorithm in the next section, which runs in O(V^2*E).

Real-valued capacities:
Although the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is only optimal on graphs
with integer capacities, the Edmonds-Karp algorithm also works
correctly on real-valued capacities.
